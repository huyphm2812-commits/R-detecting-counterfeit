# Counterfeit Transaction Detection Group Project

**Detecting fraudulent transactions using data analysis and machine learning**  
This project is focused on detecting **counterfeit financial transactions** using a sample Kaggle dataset. It demonstrates a structured approach to data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and refinement.

## My Contributions
I played a **key role** throughout the project, including:

- **Project Structure & Roadmap**: Designed the workflow and structured the project for clarity and reproducibility.   
- **Model Building & Evaluation**: Implemented machine learning models (Logistic and RandomForest)and evaluated their performance.  
- **Model Refinement**: Optimized models through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to maximize predictive accuracy.  
- **Overseeing**: Ensured smooth operations by group members.

## Project Overview
Financial fraud poses a serious risk to businesses and consumers. This project tackles this problem by identifying patterns that distinguish **legitimate transactions** from **counterfeit ones**. The workflow integrates:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends, distributions, and anomalies.  
- **Machine Learning Models** to classify transactions.  
- **Evaluation Metrics** to ensure model reliability and accuracy.  
- **Iterative Refinement** to improve predictive performance.

## Project Roadmap
The project followed a structured workflow:

1. **Data Understanding & EDA**
   - Explored dataset features, distributions, and missing values.  
   - Visualized transaction patterns, anomalies, and correlations.  
   - Identified class imbalances and potential feature issues.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new derived features to enhance model performance.  
   - Normalized and encoded categorical features.  
   - Ensured data was ready for machine learning pipelines.

3. **Model Building**
   - Tested multiple algorithms including [e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost].  
   - Built pipelines for training, validation, and prediction.  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**.  
   - Compared model performance to select the best-performing algorithm.

5. **Model Refinement**
   - Applied hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.  
   - Iteratively improved models based on evaluation metrics.
